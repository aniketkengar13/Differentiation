# Differentiation




How Does It Work?

. Function Definition: You define the function you want to integrate

In this example, f(x) = x2

. Integration Limits: 

Set the lower and upper limits of integration, a and b.


. Number of Intervals: The variable n defines the number of intervals for the
trapezoidal rule. A higher number of intervals will give a more accurate result.


. Trapezoidal Rule Calculation: The trapezoidal rule approximates the area under the
curve by summing up the areas of trapezoids formed under the curve.


. Result: The final result is printed as the approximate value of the integral.
